# Features

- **Responsive Design:** PShop's responsive design ensures optimal desktops, tablets, and smartphone performance, ensuring a seamless shopping experience across devices.

- **Cart Management:** Add desired products to your cart, update quantities, and remove items as needed with instant calculation of the total price of your cart.
